# FormsCo
Deliver fast, personalized transactional emails using API

FormsCo is a project in which I was full focus on Class-Based Views for Django Framework, I wanted to go further with this topic so every view that I developed was a Class View. The idea of the project is that you can fill up and sent a form from a static website.

- Stack: Django, Bootstrap 4
- Status: Under development
